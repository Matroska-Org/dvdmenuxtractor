	int32_t, also some internal changes of types.  Make it crack the
	keys for all titles when opening the first as to not pause later
	during playback.  Make sure to use the raw device name for access
	under Solaris as using the CSS calls does not work on the block
	device.  Make sure to get an absolute path for the directory name
	used to search the mount table with.  Update/correct some error

	located in if it didn't have any block allocated for it content.

2001-08-27 02:13  vektor

	* dvdread/: dvd_reader.c, dvd_reader.h:  - Added a GetFileSize

	reading DVD-Video discs and images.
	
	It offers DVD applications:
	
	1. A simple abstraction for reading the files on a DVD	 
	(dvd_reader.h).  2. A simple library for parsing the information
	(IFO) files    (ifo_read.h/ifo_types.h).  3. A simple library for
	parsing the navigation (NAV) packets	(nav_read.h/nav_types.h).
